# PositionCalculator-PyQt5
A program written in Python to help designers and developers work with positions.

## What is Position Calculator?

The program is intended to help you calculate positions. Who has never stopped to calculate the positions for the object to be perfectly in the center of the screen? That is where the Position Calculator comes in.

## How it works

Basically you enter the size of the window or image and then the size of the object you want to position. Then you can choose where you want to align the object and finally figure out the right position.

## When to use the Position Calculator?

Imagine you are editing an image in your favorite image manipulator and you want to position a rectangle in the right-center of the image or you are developing a game from scratch and have to work hard with positions. These are good examples of use.

## How to install

With Python installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*OR*

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note: Make sure you are in the folder where you downloaded the project.**
